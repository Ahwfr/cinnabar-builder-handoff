# Schematica for Cinnabar · v4.2

## Install the library

Disable the older Schematica demo and passenger wagon components in **Settings > Mods**. Enable **schematica-library-v4.2.wasm** with **terrain**, **controls**, and **world_draw**. Grant **render_material** to see native block textures. Grant **settings** to remember the preview style and Target info setting.

The library contains **Demo arch** and **passenger-wagon-2**. On joining a world, neither is placed. Press **Alt+J**, select a row, and click **Load selected**. Choosing a different row and loading it clears the previous guide before the new one appears.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Alt+J | Open the blueprint library |
| Alt+I | Open manipulation controls and the materials table |
| Alt+K | Open preview and placement settings |
| Alt+U | Identify the planned block you are aiming at |
| Alt+P | Re-anchor the active guide ahead of you |
| Alt+arrow keys / Alt+Page Up or Down | Nudge along X/Z or Y |
| Alt+R / Alt+M | Rotate clockwise / cycle horizontal mirror |
| Alt+L / Alt+[ / Alt+] | Cycle layer modes / adjust the layer |
| Alt+B / Alt+H | Switch preview style / toggle visibility |

Cinnabar keeps its regular chat, crouch, and pick-block controls. This release uses Alt chords so the slash keys, Numpad *, and Shift+middle-click can keep their normal Cinnabar behavior.

## Preview and placement settings

- **Block textures** uses Cinnabar's native block models and textures. The stock API uses their native opacity. **Hidden** turns off the missing-block preview. Yellow and red still mark wrong and extra blocks. [Cinnabar drawing contract](https://cinnabar.gg/docs/modding/reference/world-draw-drawing)
- **Target info** shows the expected material and coordinates under your aim. You place the block with the regular game controls. Cinnabar exposes an ordinary use pulse and a mining target override, while directed item placement and selecting a hotbar item on the player's behalf are unavailable to this mod.

## Create a library with your own files

Extract **schematica-import-v4.2-windows-x64.zip**. Keep the files together and open **Import-Schematics.cmd**. Use Ctrl-click to choose up to eight **.schematic**, **.schem**, **.litematic**, or **.mcstructure** files in one folder. It writes a single **schematica-library.cinnabar.wasm** beside a multi-file selection. A single-file selection produces **your-build.cinnabar.wasm**. Move an existing output file before converting again.

For files in different folders, use PowerShell.

```powershell
.\Import-Schematics.ps1 -Output 'C:\path\library.wasm' -InputFiles 'C:\a\one.schem','C:\b\two.schematic'
```

Each blueprint supports up to 64 blocks on each axis, 5,120 cells including air, and 128 palette entries. Translation uses Nucleation's Geyser-derived block mappings. Complex states may differ after translation or rotation. World capture and printer automation remain unavailable.

## Build from source

```powershell
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo test --locked --workspace
.\Build-Schematica.ps1 'C:\path\to\your-build.schematic'
```

For the native importer source, build `schematica-builder` for Windows and `schematica-guest` for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Place the compiled guest next to the executable as `schematica-guest-template.bin`. The guest's JSON-UI assets are checked into `guest/ui`. Regenerate them after editing the layout with `.\guest\menu_layout.ps1 using PowerShell 7`.

The guest targets Cinnabar's extension 0.1.0 and world-draw 0.2.0 interfaces. The WIT snapshot is from [Cinnabar](https://github.com/cinnabar-mc/cinnabar) under the license in `guest/wit/LICENSE`. The layout reference is [Lunatrius Schematica](https://github.com/Lunatrius/Schematica), whose MIT license is included in `SCHEMATICA-LICENSE.txt`.
